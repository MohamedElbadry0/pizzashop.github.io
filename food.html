       <h2>STEP 1</h2>
Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan, then cook the onion and garlic over a medium heat for 5 mins until soft. Add the paprika, tomatoes and stock, then bring to the boil.

<h2>STEP 2 </h2>
<p>Turn down the heat to a simmer, stir in the pasta and cook for 7 mins, stirring occasionally to stop the pasta from sticking.

      <h1>Alfredo</h1>
      <p>Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium high heat. Add the chicken thighs and fry for around 10 mins, turning half way, until they are golden brown and cooked through. Set aside to cool a little, then use two forks to shred.</p>
      <p>Once the pasta is cooked, use tongs to transfer the pasta straight from the water into the frying pan with the cream mixture. Sprinkle most of the parmesan over and use the tongs to toss it all together, adding a splash of the pasta water if it looks a little stiff. Season well, then tip into bowls. Top with the remaining parmesan, a scattering of parsley, and black pepper.</p>
